1. With no compile time options, code fails because gcc has stack protection on by deafult and it does not let the program execute the stack.
2. With stack protection disabled, code still throws error because segmentation fault occurs.
3. With executable stack disabled, code throws error.
4. When both executable stack is disabled and stack protection is turned off, the attack can occur easily.
